Put a son object in imageTarget and adjust its position. The unity will use computer camera when strating to play.<ar>
Use our computer camera to shoot the image we just have chosen in Vuforia engine in reality.We can just see the son object.<ar>
We can add UI and script to control the object like we doing it in normal 3d scene.
